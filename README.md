This package now **fully supports GPT-4**! üî•

We also just released a [TypeScript chatgpt-plugin package](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-plugin-ts) which contains helpers and examples to make it as easy as possible to start building your own ChatGPT Plugins in JS/TS. Even if you don't have developer access to ChatGPT Plugins yet, you can still use the [chatgpt-plugin](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-plugin-ts) repo to get a head start on building your own plugins locally.

If you have access to the `gpt-4` model, you can run the following to test out the CLI with GPT-4:

```bash
npx chatgpt@latest --model gpt-4 "Hello world"
```

</p>

We still support both the official ChatGPT API and the unofficial proxy API, but we now recommend using the official API since it's significantly more robust and supports **GPT-4**.

| Method                      | Free?  | Robust? | Quality?                        |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `ChatGPTAPI`                | ‚ùå No  | ‚úÖ Yes  | ‚úÖÔ∏è Real ChatGPT models + GPT-4 |
| `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå NoÔ∏è  | ‚úÖ ChatGPT webapp               |

**Note**: We strongly recommend using `ChatGPTAPI` since it uses the officially supported API from OpenAI. We will likely remove support for `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI` in a future release.

1. `ChatGPTAPI` - Uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model with the official OpenAI chat completions API (official, robust approach, but it's not free)
2. `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI` - Uses an unofficial proxy server to access ChatGPT's backend API in a way that circumvents Cloudflare (uses the real ChatGPT and is pretty lightweight, but relies on a third-party server and is rate-limited)

The [official OpenAI chat completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) has been released, and it is now the default for this package! üî•

| Method                      | Free?  | Robust?  | Quality?                |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `ChatGPTAPI`                | ‚ùå No  | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚úÖÔ∏è Real ChatGPT models |
| `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚òëÔ∏è Maybe | ‚úÖ Real ChatGPT         |

**Note**: We strongly recommend using `ChatGPTAPI` since it uses the officially supported API from OpenAI. We may remove support for `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI` in a future release.

1. `ChatGPTAPI` - Uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model with the official OpenAI chat completions API (official, robust approach, but it's not free)
2. `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI` - Uses an unofficial proxy server to access ChatGPT's backend API in a way that circumvents Cloudflare (uses the real ChatGPT and is pretty lightweight, but relies on a third-party server and is rate-limited)

We now provide three ways of accessing the unofficial ChatGPT API, all of which have tradeoffs:

| Method                      | Free?  | Robust?  | Quality?          |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------- |
| `ChatGPTAPI`                | ‚ùå No  | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚òëÔ∏è Mimics ChatGPT |
| `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚òëÔ∏è Maybe | ‚úÖ Real ChatGPT   |
| `ChatGPTAPIBrowser` (v3)    | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No    | ‚úÖ Real ChatGPT   |

**Note**: I recommend that you use either `ChatGPTAPI` or `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI`.

1. `ChatGPTAPI` - (Used to use) `text-davinci-003` to mimic ChatGPT via the official OpenAI completions API (most robust approach, but it's not free and doesn't use a model fine-tuned for chat)
2. `ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI` - Uses an unofficial proxy server to access ChatGPT's backend API in a way that circumvents Cloudflare (uses the real ChatGPT and is pretty lightweight, but relies on a third-party server and is rate-limited)
3. `ChatGPTAPIBrowser` - (_deprecated_; v3.5.1 of this package) Uses Puppeteer to access the official ChatGPT webapp (uses the real ChatGPT, but very flaky, heavyweight, and error prone)

OpenAI has disabled the leaked chat model we were previously using, so we're now defaulting to `text-davinci-003`, which is not free.

We've found several other hidden, fine-tuned chat models, but OpenAI keeps disabling them, so we're searching for alternative workarounds.

This package no longer requires any browser hacks ‚Äì **it is now using the official OpenAI completions API** with a leaked model that ChatGPT uses under the hood. üî•

```ts
import { ChatGPTAPI } from 'chatgpt'

const api = new ChatGPTAPI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
})

const res = await api.sendMessage('Hello World!')
console.log(res.text)
```

Please upgrade to `chatgpt@latest` (at least [v4.0.0](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/releases/tag/v4.0.0)). The updated version is **significantly more lightweight and robust** compared with previous versions. You also don't have to worry about IP issues or rate limiting.

Huge shoutout to [@waylaidwanderer](https://github.com/waylaidwanderer) for discovering the leaked chat model!

If you run into any issues, we do have a pretty active [ChatGPT Hackers Discord](https://www.chatgpthackers.dev/) with over 8k developers from the Node.js & Python communities.

## Install and demo

This demo use `Cohere`. The only thing that needs to change is how you initialize the api with an `apiKey`.

To run the included demo:

1. clone repo
2. install node deps
3. set `COHERE_API_KEY` in .env
4. run yarn tsc index.ts
5. run node index.js
6. load localhost:3000 in the browser

## Compatibility

- This package is ESM-only.
- This package was made with `node = 18`.
- This module assumes that `fetch` is installed.
- If `node < 18`, you may fix some bugs.
